Hieroglyphic Translation to English

Overview
The Hieroglyphic Translation to English project is a Python-based tool designed to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs into English text. This project leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques to interpret hieroglyphic symbols and provide accurate translations, making the study of ancient Egyptian texts more accessible to researchers, historians, and enthusiasts.
Features

Hieroglyph Recognition: Identifies and processes hieroglyphic symbols from input images or text representations.
Translation Engine: Converts recognized hieroglyphs into meaningful English translations.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line or graphical interface (depending on implementation) for ease of use.
Extensible Dataset: Supports custom datasets for training and improving translation accuracy.

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Virtualenv (recommended for isolated environments)

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/MOsama10/Hieroglyphic-translation-to-English.git
cd Hieroglyphic-translation-to-English


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have the required packages listed in requirements.txt. Example dependencies might include:

numpy
tensorflow or pytorch (for machine learning models)
opencv-python (for image processing, if applicable)



Usage

Prepare Input: Provide hieroglyphic data as images or text files (refer to the data/ directory for sample formats).

Run the Translation Script:
python translate.py --input path/to/hieroglyph_image.jpg

Replace path/to/hieroglyph_image.jpg with the path to your input file.

View Output: The translated English text will be displayed in the console or saved to an output file (e.g., output/translation.txt).


For detailed usage instructions, including supported input formats and options, run:
python translate.py --help
