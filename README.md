## Approaches

### 1. Regular Fine-Tuning

Fine-tunes pre-trained LLaMA models on a dataset of Gardiner codes paired with their English translations. This approach adapts the model specifically for the hieroglyphic translation task.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Combines retrieval mechanisms with generation models. Relevant translations are retrieved from a database to provide context, enhancing the model's output accuracy.

### 3. Prompt Engineering

Utilizes carefully crafted prompts to guide the LLaMA models in translating hieroglyphs without additional training. This lightweight approach leverages the model's existing knowledge.

## Evaluation

Evaluation scripts are provided to assess the performance of each approach using metrics such as BLEU scores and accuracy rates. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `notebooks/` directory.
